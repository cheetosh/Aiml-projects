This report presents the results of a comprehensive study on industrial IoT integration in manufacturing plants. 
Over the last year, 20 factories implemented sensor-based data collection to monitor equipment performance and energy usage. 
Machine learning algorithms were used to predict equipment failures before they occurred, reducing downtime by 30 percent. 
Additionally, AI-driven control systems optimized production schedules and energy distribution, resulting in a 15 percent increase in overall efficiency. 
The study concludes that digital transformation through IoT and AI is a key driver of sustainable industrial growth.
